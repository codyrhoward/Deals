# Deal App
## Technologies Used
  * This app is React on the frontend and Rails on the backend
### Approach Taken
  * I used my Noticeboard app that we build as a guide. This app is full crud with a working front and backend.
### Unsolved Issues
  * I would like to pull from restaurant apis to make deals in real time.
